                   <dt>Seed</dt>
                   <dd>-This first growth stages of mango is the seed phase. This means that the mango is in the form of a seed. The seed of mango is medium in size, oblong in shape, rough in texture, and white to brown in color. That is the mango fruit seed characteristics.
                   <br>Dry mature mango seed is capable of growing. There are cases that the seeds are too young and theres a low percentage of growing on that kind of seed. It is important that it is fully mature and dry which will surely grow. A best germination will happen.
                   <br>One mango fruit has one seeds inside. And the technique to get those high quality seeds for planting is make the fruit to rippen. Make it in the most mature appearance. It will turn to green and then it will ripe which produces quality seeds. Dry the mango seeds under the sunlight and start growing it. </dd>
                   
                   <dt>Germinating</dt>
                   <dd>-This growth stages of mango start to germinate. This means that the mango seeds will produce some roots and small green leafy leaves. Germinating mango seeds will have high percentage of germination if you have a quality seeds. The quality seeds are the mature seeds which are capable of growing. It needs more harder which surely a sign of a good seeds. Brown or dark brown color seeds are best.
                   <br>You can buy some mango seeds near your location, like in the agriculture market or store. They sell those seeds with coated color which help the seed to stay last long. But it’s rare to find this kind of seeds because usually people gets seeds directly from the fruit. They buy fruit from the market and then get the seeds inside.
                   <br>If you want to germinate seeds and grow it, the best way you should do is grow it first on the seed box. The seed box have many small container which you can put the seeds and grow. But it is not applicable to those seed box. Instead use small containers like cans, bottles or anything.
                   <br>Prepare your soil, make a hole around 2 to 4 inch deep and put one seed per hole. Cover it with soil and then water it. After 3 to 5 weeks the mango seeds will start germinating. This takes few weeks in order to produce some roots and eventually you will see some small leaves. You need to take care for it to grow it well.
                   </dd>

                   <dt>Young Seedling</dt>
                   <dd>- This growth stages of mango is seedling phase. This means that the mango is in the form of small plant that show of its sprouted roots and few leaves appearance.
                   <br>The mango seedlings needs more care as there stem are very soft. It’s very easy to break so you should care for it from the strong winds and from the animals. Animals can destroy the leaves and cut its stem, you don’t like it to happen.
                   <br>The seedlings of mango is great when it have a healthy germination. You need to water it regularly especially when its too hot. Cultivate the soil around the mango seedlings and apply the pre fertilizer application.
                   <br>This way it can grow well. It can survive in its final location. It needs enough water to grow better.In transplanting the mango seedling, you need to find a best location for it. Look for a place where there is abundant source of sunlight which will help the tree to grow well.

                   <dt>Booting</dt>
                   <dd>-During the booting stage, the head of the wheat develops and becomes visible beneath the sheath on the stalk. 
                            The booting stage ends when the tips of the head, called awns, begin to emerge. </dd>
                   
                   <dt>Heading and Flowering Stage</dt>
                   <dd>- The heading and flowering stage begins when the awns emerge from the sheath. 
                        When the awns have emerged the flowering begins and pollination and fertilization occurs. 
                        It is important again during the flowering stage that all the plants in a field flower at the same time.
                        Right after fertilization, the embryo and endosperm begin to form. </dd>
                   
                   <dt>Older Mango</dt>
                   <dd>-This growth stages of mango is in the form of mature plant. This means that the mango started to produce more green leafy hard leaves and produce more stronger stem. When it gets enough water, sunlight and fertilizer, the best mango will appear.
                    As a fruit or tree grower you should do your job to make it more healthy. It needs more care than to the previous stages. More efforts and energy to release.
                    You need to apply enough fertilizer and continuous watering as it will produce a healthier and stronger plant. Your efforts here will surely make the plants to bear more flowers and more fruits to produce.
                    You need to do it in this stage so that you will not worry anymore after.
                    </dd>

                   <dt>Mango Flowering</dt>
                   <dd>- This growth stages of mango is it start blooming flowers. This means that the mango is in 7 to 10 years old. During this time the beautiful yellow hard flower begins to show off.
                    This stage needs more fertilizer and water. You need to apply water regularly as it very important. But don’t apply too much water. Remember this is a tree so just enough water will be good. And usually people don’t water the tree. But water is essential.

                   <dt>Mango Fruit Bearing</dt>
                   <dd>- This growth stages of mango is it begins to produce fruits for the first time. Yes, from the flowers it will form into a young mango fruits.
                   The characteristics of mango fruits are it is color green when young and color dark green when older, then turn to yellow when ripe. This looks like a round to heart in shape depends on variety. It has a smooth skin. It has a good smell when already ripe. It depends on how much care you applied.

                   <dt>Harvesting</dt>
                   <dd>-This growth stages of mango is ready for harvesting. This mean that the mango is mature enough. It is already ripe. This is perfect to harvest.
                    When the mango fruit has a smooth and green to yellowish fruit, it indicates its maturity, you can now get it. This has enough length and look differ compare to the previous weeks.

                   <dd>- In general, fertilizers for bearing trees should contain 9 to 15 percent potassium and phosphorus should be reduced to 2 to 4 percent. Commonly available fertilizer mixes that are satisfactory for mango trees include 6-6-6 and 8-3-9-2, the 2 indicating magnesium. </dd>

                   <dd>- Feed established mango trees three times a year – spring, summer and fall – by sprinkling about 1/4 pound around the dripline of young trees, gradually increasing to 1 pound of fertilizer per year of the tree's age. </dd>

                   <dd>- We recommend that no nitrogen fertilizers be applied. A light layer of mulch will protect the root system and as it decomposes, will provide enough nitrogen.
