                   <dt>Propagation Method </dt>
                   <dd>-  An Orange tree can be reproduced by seed or with the help of vegetative propagation, by T-budding. Learn how to grow an orange 
                          tree from a seed in few steps. <br>
                          Step 1: Prepare a pot, having sterilized pot soil <br>
                          Step 2: Plant your orange seed into this pot at about 1/2 inch depth in pot soil <br>
                          Step 3:  Cover this pot by using any wrapping material <br>
                          Step 4: Keep this pot in a warm place and give some time to grow <br>
                          Step 5: When seedling appears, move your pot to the sunny and open area so that it can grow well. <br>     
                          Step 6: Water it regularly <br>
                        However, planting oranges with the help of budding are fast growing and high yielding in nature. </dd>
                   
                   <dt>Growing Oranges / Planting Season </dt>
                   <dd>- Planting oranges should be done in the beginning of the rainy season (Monsoon season) because the risk of plant death is comparatively low 
                           in the rainy season. Rainwater helps the plant to fix faster. But, the best time for planting orange plant is from July to August. </dd>
                   
                   <dt>Orange Harvesting</dt>
                   <dd>-  Generally An orange plant becomes mature at the age of one year. After which they start flowering and budding, but not in proper amount 
                            or less no. of fruit are obtained in the first harvesting.
                           Usually, Depending on the types of orange cultivated, from the 4th year onward, you will be able to harvesting oranges. And an orange 
                           tree used to give fruit for about 25 yrs in an economic life. Collect those tasty and delicious oranges at three different intervals, during a year. 
                           Harvest them in autumn, summer, and in the rainy season. </dd>
                   <dt>Spacing</dt>
                   <dd>-  Prepare a pit, having size 80 cm X 80 cm X 80 cm. Add about 10 kg of rotten cow dung manure to the topsoil of the pit. Plant the Oranges, 
                            keeping a distance of 7 meters between the rows and 7 meters apart. However, the spacing in orange cultivation depends on the type of soil, method 
                            and the cultivars, selected for the cultivation. </dd>
                  
                   <dt> Irrigation in Orange Farming</dt>
                   <dd>- Orange plant require more water as like the Banana Plant for the repetitive growth of fruit plant. However, irrigation in your orange farm 
                           depends on many factors like agro-climatic condition, plant age, and soil type. Give water your orange trees at a regular interval like at a week in
                           the summer season and at 10 days from monsoon to winter. However, first irrigation should be done, just after the orange plantation.
                           Avoid waterlogging the tree, because orange trees are very sensitive to the water stagnation. A fully grown Orange plant needs minimum 20 
                           watering in a particular year i.e 1,400 mm water. However, farming with drip irrigation system is the best and beneficial in any commercial crops. </dd>

                   <dt>Climate Condition</dt>
                   <dd>- Likewise Mango Farming and Banana Farming, Oranges are also cultivated widely as they can grow well in the 
                    tropical region as well as in sub-tropical regions up to a height of 1500 m. However, a dry climatic condition is  
                    avourable for profitable orange cultivation for obtaining higher oranges production. </dd>
                  
                   <dt>Soil Requirement</dt>
                   <dd>- Oranges can be cultivated on a wide variety of soil like sandy loam to loamy soil, alluvial, red to black soils with too much
                       clay. However, a soil with high fertility, good drainage power, lime-free soil with good salt absorption power and light loam is 
                       considered as the best and most  favourable for the orange cultivation.
                       As soil ph for citrus trees is about 6.0 to 7.0 and oranges are also a citrus tree, it is smartness to cultivate them on soil, 
                       which has pH ranging between 5. 8 to 7.3 for best production. </dd>

                <dt>Land Selection and its Preparation</dt>
                <dd>- Select a site for your orange farm, from where there is a full availability of transport for transporting your oranges in the market.
                          Also, it should not be too cold during the winter and monsoon season because this invites numbers of pest and disease to your farm. It is also 
                          suggested to give windbreaks on sides of your farm from heavy winds since hot and heavy winds during summer lead to dropping down of orange 
                          flower and budding fruits. 
                          Prepare your soil, favorable for orange farming like managing ph about 5.8 to 7.3, make rich your soil in all essential organic matters for 
                          producing more fruits. </dd>

               <dd>- Basically, an orange plant needs Nitrogen, Potassium, Phosphate along with some Micro-nutrient Magnesium, Zinc, Iron, etc for good 
                            development of vegetative plant growth. Keeping orange tree full of organic manure is helpful to the orange plant in bearing healthy and
