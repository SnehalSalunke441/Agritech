                   <dt>Yellow rust</dt>
                   <dd>- Yellow rust (also called stripe rust) and brown rust (also called leaf rust) are the major diseases of wheat which affect almost all of India. Rust spores that land on wheat plants germinate and infect the plant. Tiny tubes penetrate host cells to withdraw nutrients. Fungus tissue proliferates beneath the epidermis until the epidermis bursts and pustules erupt. Each pustule contains thousands of spores that can be carried by the wind to infect other plants. Grain yield is reduced by interference with grain filling, which results in a reduction in the number and size of kernels.   </dd>

                   <dt>Powdery Mildew</dt>
                   <dd>- In India, powdery mildew is widespread in the Punjab with losses of grain yield of 20% in highly infected crop. Since none of the recommended varieties is resistant to the disease, the use of fungicides has been recommended. Research in India has shown an 18% increase in wheat yield following two fungicide sprays for control of powdery mildew.  Powdery mildew on wheat is very well managed by spraying fungicides.  </dd>

               <dl>
                   <dt>Downy Mildew</dt>
                   <dd>-The downy mildew diseases have been a major limiting factor in production of maize in Asia since the early 1900s. Java downy mildew is of great importance in Indonesia, where depending on the year, 20-80% of the total maize harvests are lost.  Philippine downy mildew is widespread in Nepal, northern Vietnam, northern India and in the Philippines, where the damage usually affects 40-60% of the total maize yield. Brown stripe downy mildew incidence is greatest in regions of high rainfall in India and has been reported from most maize-growing regions of that country with yield losses ranging from 20-90%.  In Nepal, downy mildew epidemics have caused maize losses as high as 50%. In India and the Philippines, downy mildew is estimated to lower national maize production by 13% and 8% respectively. 
                   <br><br>
                   - Downy mildew infections occur both as a result of soil borne overwintering spores which infect young plants and from spores produced by nearby infected hosts. Once inside maize plants, the fungus moves systemically throughout the plant. Infected leaves show dis -colored streaks and have a mildew growth. Most early infected plants usually die within a month. When cobs are formed, they are small and poorly-filled.
                   <br><br>
                   - Research has demonstrated that systemic fungicides applied as seed treatments and/or foliar sprays provide excellent control of downy mildew.  Yield increases of 8-10% are possible through seed treatment alone. Seed treatments protect young seedlings from soil-borne spores as the fungicide is taken up systemically in the developing seedling. Research has shown that seed treatment combined with one foliar spray to control brown stripe downy mildew increased maize yield by 34%.

                   <dt>MULTIPURPOSE FRUIT SPRAYS</dt>
                   <dd>- Gardening stores often sell multipurpose fruit sprays, which contain both insecticide and fungicide. According to Purdue University, most multipurpose fruit sprays contain two insecticides and a fungicide. For instance, they may contain one pesticide that works against sucking insects and one that works against chewing insects. Some environmentally-friendly sprays, such as Organicide, contain a mixture of oils with different densities to work against different pests and diseases. Multipurpose sprays can be more convenient than separate fungicides and pesticides, because they come with fungicide and insecticide chemicals that are considered compatible with each other. </dd>
