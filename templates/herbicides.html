                   <dt> Wheat - I </dt>
                   <dd>-Weeds reduce the yield of wheat by competing with the crop for water, light, nutrients and space. Uncontrolled weeds can reduce wheat production in South Asia by 50-80%.  Weed infestation is the main cause of low wheat yields in Pakistan and India and typically reduces wheat production by 25-35%.  A survey in Peshawar region in Pakistan found that there were 31 major weeds in wheat fields. 91% of wheat farmers in Peshawar reported yield reduction in wheat due to weeds of 20-50%.    Competition from uncontrolled weeds has been reported as a severe constraint on wheat production throughout South Asia. </dd>
                   <dt>Wheat - II  </dt>
                   <dd>-In India herbicides are used on 10% of the wheat area to control grassy weeds and on 20-25% of the area to control broadleaf weeds.  In the rice-wheat system of Punjab, Harayana, western Uttar Pradash and Uttarakhand, 57% of the wheat area is treated with herbicides. About 50% of Pakistanâ€™s wheat acreage is treated with herbicides. In Bangladesh herbicides are typically not used with one hand weeding being the recommended practice although farmers are reluctant to weed the field even one time.  5-10% of wheat farmers in Nepal apply herbicides.  Weed problems in Nepal have become so great that wheat fields are often harvested before maturity and together with the weeds, is fed to livestock.  </dd>

                <dt>Maize</dt>
                <dd>In Asia, maize is largely a rainy season crop. Because of warm and moist weather, a variety of grass and broadleaf weeds invade maize fields frequently even before the crop germinates. Weeds compete with maize plants for space, moisture, nutrients and light and, if left uncontrolled, can reduce maize yields by 29-74%.  Traditionally, manual hand weeding has been the predominant method of weed control used by maize farmers in Asia.  If performed with enough frequency and at the right times, hand weeding results in maize yields that are equivalent to yields with herbicides.  However, due to shortage of labour and frequent monsoon rains and high temperatures during the early growth period of maize, hand weeding is often delayed or neglected altogether.  As a result, severe uncontrolled weed infestations have been identified as one of the major reasons causing low maize yields in Asia.  In the Philippines, actual losses due to weeds in maize fields have been reported at 15-30%. In India, 39 trials compared maize yields with herbicides to yields obtained with farmers weed control methods; the maize yields with herbicides were 19% higher. </dd>
