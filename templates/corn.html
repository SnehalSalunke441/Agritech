                   <dt>Land Prepartion</dt>
                   <dd>- Maize requires a firm and compact seedbed free from stubbles and weed. One deep ploughing should be given, followed by two or three harrowings to bring the soil 
                    to a fine tilth. Add 10-15 tons of FYM or compost before last harrowing and mix thoroughly with harrow. </dd>
                   
                   <dt>Seed and Sowing</dt>
                   <dd>- (a). Selection of seed: Seed should be free from insect, pest and disease free. It should be free from weed seed. It should be purchased from reliable
                    sources. It should be high germination percentage.
                     <br>  (b). Seed treatment: To protect the maize crop from seed and major soil borne diseases and insect-pests, seed treatment with fungicides and insecticides before
                       sowing is advisable/ recommended </dd>

                   <dt>Sowing Method</dt>
                   <dd>- Maize seed should be sown with dibbling or drilling method. It is depending on purpose of sowing, type of of maize, varieties and farm condition. Seed
                    should not be sown more 5-6 cm depth of soil.
                    Maize seed should be sown with dibbling or drilling method. It is depending on purpose of sowing, type of of maize, varieties and farm condition. 
                    Seed should not be sown more 5-6 cm depth of soil.</dd>
                   
                    <dt>Nutrient Management</dt>
                    <dd>- Response of maize to applied organic manures is notable and hence integrated nutrient management (INM) is very important nutrient management 
                    strategy in maize based production systems. Therefore, for higher economic yield of maize, application of 10 t FYM ha-1, 10-15 days prior to sowing 
                    supplemented with150-180 kg N, 70-80 kg P2O5, 70-80 kg K2O and 25 kg ZnSO4 ha-1 is recommended. </dd>
                    
                    <dt>Water Management</dt>
                    <dd>- The irrigation water management depends on season as about 80 % of maize is cultivated during monsoon season particularly under rainfed conditions. However,
                    in areas with assured irrigation facilities are available, depending upon the rains and moisture holding capacity of the soil, irrigation should be 
                    applied as and when required by the crop and first irrigation should be applied very carefully where in water should not overflow on the ridges/beds.  </dd>
    
                   <dt> Harvesting</dt>
                   <dd>- Cobs which are to be utilized as grain should be harvested when the grains are almost dry or containing roughly 20 % moisture. For sweet corn harvesting, harvest when 
                    tassels begin to turn brown and cobs start to swell. Kernels should be full and milky. Pull ears downward and twist to take off stalk. </dd>

                   <dt>Climate </dt>
                   <dd>- > Maize does well on a wide range of climatic conditions, and it is grown in the tropical as well as temperate regions, from sea-levels up to
                    altitudes of 2500m. It is however susceptible to frost at all stages of its growth. </dd>
                   
                   <dt>Soil Requirements</dt>
                   <dd>- Maize can be grown successfully in variety of soils ranging from loamy sand to clay loam. However, soils with good organic matter content having 
                    high water holding capacity with neutral pH are considered good for higher productivity. Being a sensitive crop to moisture stress particularly excess soil 
                    moisture and salinity stresses; it is desirable to avoid low lying fields having poor drainage and also the field having higher salinity. </dd>

                   <dd>- To achieve higher productivity and resource-use efficiencies optimum plant stand is the key factor. The seed rate varies depending on purpose, 
                    seed size, plant type, season,sowing methods etc. </dd>

                   <dt>Weed Management</dt>
                   <dd>- Weeds are the serious problem in maize, particularly during kharif /monsoon season they compete with maize for nutrient and causes yield loss up to 35 %.
                    Therefore, timely weed management is needed for achieving higher yield. Atrazine being a selective and broad-spectrum herbicide in maize checks the emergence
                    of wide spectrum of weeds. Pre-emergence application of Atrazine (Atratraf 50 wp, Gesaprim 500 fw) @ of 1.0-1.5 kg a.i ha-1 in 600 litre water, 
                    Alachlor (Lasso) @ 2-2.5 kg a.i ha-1, Metolachlor (Dual) @ 1.5-2.0 kg a.i ha-1, Pendamethalin (Stomp) @ 1-1.5 kg a.i. ha-1 are effective way for control of many annual and broad leaved weeds. </dd>
                   
                   <dt>Plant Protection</dt>
                   <dd>- (A) Diseases: <br>
                          Leaf Blight: Manifestation of oval to round, yellowish-purple spots on leaves. The affected leaves dry up and appear as if burnt. In severe cases,
                          the plants may become stunted, resulting in poorly-formed ears.
                         <br>Control:
                         <br> The crop can be sprayed with Dithane M-45 or Indofil @ 35-40 gms or Blue Copper @55 -60 gms in 18 litres water, 2 -3 sprays at 15 days interval, will 
                          effectively control the disease.

                         <br>(B) Insect Pests:
                          <br>1) Stem borer: These borers feed on leaves in the earlier stages. Later on they bore into the stem and cobs, rendering the plant unproductive.
                        <br> Control:
                         <br>- After harvest, the stalks and stubbles should be collected from the field and burnt.
                         <br>- Crop can be sprayed twice with Thiodan 35 EC @ 27 ml in 18 litres water, once 20-25 days after germination and the second spray at 
                         the time of grain formation (in endemic areas).

                         <br> 2) Red Hairy Caterpillars: Caterpillars feed and destroy the whole plant if the attack is in the early stages of growth.
                        <br>Control:
                         <br>- Egg masses and young caterpillars should be collected as soon as detected, and destroyed.
                         <br>- The field should be ploughed out after the crop is harvested, so as to expose pupae.

                          <br>3) Aphids: Tiny, soft bodied insects, usually green in colour. Nymphs and adults suck the sap from leaves and young shoots.
                        <br>Control:
                        <br>The crop can be sprayed with Rogor 30 EC @ 18 ml in 18 litres water.

                          <br>4) Grass hoppers: Short-winged hoppers, laying eggs in the soil at a depth of 7.5 to 20 cms, adults feed on foliage.
                        <br>Control:
                        <br>Thiodan 35 EC @ 25 ml or Ekalux 25 EC@ 28 mi in 18 litres water can be sprayed.

                         <br> 5) Termites: These pests attack young seedlings as well as mature plants; attack is also visible on roots and lower parts of the plants.
                        <br>Control:
                         <br>Thiodan 4 % Dust @ 12-15 kg per hectare is applied and mixed well with the soil.  </dd>
